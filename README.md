# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where the `express.json()` middleware fails to correctly parse the JSON request body, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js application uses `express.json()` to parse incoming JSON data. However, under certain circumstances (e.g., incorrect content-type header, invalid JSON format), the request body might not be correctly parsed, leading to `req.body` being undefined or containing unexpected values.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with a JSON payload (e.g., using curl or Postman).
5. Observe the server's response and the console output.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage situations where the JSON parsing fails, ensuring that the application doesn't crash and provides informative error messages to the client. This is accomplished using a custom middleware function before the route handler.

## Additional Notes

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in web applications. Always consider cases where the application might receive invalid data and implement appropriate measures to prevent unexpected behavior.
